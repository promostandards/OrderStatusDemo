Project Notes:

The db code is written for mysql server

The vendor number used in the mysql schema located at src\sqlSchemaMysql is the customer number you have assgned to the supplier/distributor whose order status
you are pulling.

The config folder is located at \PromostandardOrderStatus\src\utils\config 

There you have the mysqlConfig (for mysql connections) and the paramConfig (for setting which querytype to use for the vendor for the demo) and also if it should be an xml output or mysql update/insert. This code has been configured for query type 3 and 4.
